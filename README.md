## Get the data
You have to download the csv file from the [European AI safety cities sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FETP5mYMquMH6K1v8O_K6IQ-yLibroEBJPcdT6lLYFw/). Make sure to go the right page in the Google Sheet. 

## Process the data
The data must be processed, which is what the `process_data.ipynb` notebook is for. 

## Upload the processed data 
The `hubs_with_coords.csv` and `cities_with_coords.csv` must be upload to their respective layer on https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/enais-city-overview_915934. I think you need my (Teun) account for this. You need to be logged in to see the edit button. 

## Done! 
This should be self-explanatory, but otherwise you can contact me at mailvanteun@gmail.com.
