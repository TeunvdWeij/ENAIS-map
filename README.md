## Get the data
You have to download the csv file from the [European AIS groups sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nNLhqt2C2_BQgeez8H_-Oa-lwaHFA6sudBMy-TqXcjA/edit). Make sure to go the right page in the Google Sheet. 

## Process the data
The data must be processed, which is what the `process_data.ipynb` notebook is for. 

## Upload the processed data 
The produced category CSVs must be uploaded to their respective layer on https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/enais-city-overview_915934. I think you need Teun's or Manuel's account for this. You need to be logged in to see the edit button. 

## Done! 
This should be self-explanatory, but otherwise you can contact me at mailvanteun@gmail.com.
