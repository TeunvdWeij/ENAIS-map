19, Karlsruhe,Karlsruhe,"I (Walter Laurito) am working on a project at SERI MATS right now, which I might continue in my city Karlsruhe afterwards. I'm also pursuing a PhD there and try to integrate AI Safety topics there, since I have some freedom in choosing what do work on. Apart from me, there are 5-6 people from the local EA community interested in AI Safety. Karlsruhe is famous for its university and great education in computer science in Germany. Furthermore, Karlsruhe has many different research labs... I think having talks, presentations and meetups about AI safety could be very valuable there... Once, I'm back from Berkeley, I will think about that more.
